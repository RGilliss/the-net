- As a user I want to be able to place a pin at the location that I double clicked because that's where I want my pin!
- As a user when I add a pin to a location I can see the pin appear on the map and I see a menu appear where I can add information because I want to be able to be specific about what my pin is all about

- As a user I want to be able to click on any perviously created pin and see the information for that pin because I am forgetful
- I want to be able to click a pin and edit or delete information on that pin, or delete the in entirely because I don't want to share that information anymore

- As a user I can see a filter menu that presents various categories that display pins with certain "tags" or information (e.g. Steelhead, Freshwater, Date range) becauase I have specific interests and I don't want to see pins that aren't of interest to me

User login path:

- As a user I can login to The Net using my social media profile because it's easier than remembering a password
- When I am logged in, I want to be able to see the map, all the pins on the map, and all the pins I have created (in a different colour code) and (stretch: all my 'favourite' pins)
- (Stretch:) The pins that I have created can be shared to any users or kept private for me
