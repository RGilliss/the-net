## App

user input, being able to place pins with information about fishing areas, catches, etc 
        Uses Google maps API. DB for user input data persist, 

        - Implement restrictions of where you can drop pins (restricted areas, reserve land)

- salt/fresh water
- fish type
- date
- distance from current location
- distance from shore
- if we do another area than Vancouver Island, we might want to filter by region? Area?
- (stretch) private/public/group

As a user I want to be able to input information into a search bar to take me to a location on the map or search for an area because I know where I want to go
As a user I want to be able to drag myself around the Vancouver Island map because I want to easily explore the map area
As a user I want to be able to double click on any part of the map because I want to place a pin or seeing regulation anywhere I want
As a user I want to be able to place a pin at the location that I double clicked because that's where I want my pin!
As a user when I add a pin to a location I can see the pin appear on the map and I see a menu appear where I can add information because I want to be able to be specific about what my pin is all about

As a user I can add information to the menu such as my name/user name catch, a picture, a description, time of day, date, bear sightings

As a user I can see the fishing regulations for the area I clicked on because I want to be informed about the area's regulations 
After I enter my information into the menu, I can click submit and the information will be saved to the pin location because I want to be able to refer to this information later and I want other people to be able to see my pin
As a user I want to be able to click on any perviously created pin and see the information for that pin because I am forgetful
I want to be able to click a pin and edit or delete information on that pin, or delete the in entirely because I don't want to share that information anymore

As a user I can see a filter menu that presents various options that I can select pins with different tags
As a user I want to be able to filter the selected tags so that I am not viewing pins that aren't of interest to me

Stretch: 

As a user I can login to The Net using my social media profile because it's easier than remembering a password
When I am logged in, I want to be able to see the map, all the pins on the map, and all the pins I have created (in a different colour code)
The pins that I have created can be shared to any users or kept private for me
